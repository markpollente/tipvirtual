      <p className="paragraph">The founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along 20th Avenue of Cubao as their answer
        to the Philippine government’s call for dispersal to decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the years,
        the Quezon City campus acquired adjacent properties, including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard in the early
        2000s. At present, T.I.P. Quezon City has ten (10) main buildings spread out in its 3.3-hectare site.

        In 2019, T.I.P. opened the T.I.P. TechnoCoRe building in its Quezon City
        campus. It is a seven-storey innovation hub housing T.I.P.’s state-of-the-art classrooms, seminar rooms,
        computer rooms, and engineering, computing, and fabrication laboratories.
